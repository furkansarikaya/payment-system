# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Payment System follows Clean Architecture principles with a microservices approach.

## Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
3. **Security by Design**: Security considerations at every layer
4. **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling
