# Security Overview

## Security Architecture

The Payment System implements multiple security layers:

### Transport Security
- **TLS 1.3**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: No unencrypted communications

### Application Security
- **Hybrid Encryption**: RSA + AES for unlimited data sizes
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Unique AES keys per request
- **Secure Key Storage**: File-based key management with proper permissions

### Data Security
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Credit card numbers, CVV automatically masked
- **No Data Persistence**: No sensitive data stored or logged
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

### Access Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Mitigated by TLS + Certificate validation
2. **Data Interception**: Mitigated by end-to-end encryption
3. **Key Compromise**: Mitigated by key rotation and backup strategies
4. **Injection Attacks**: Mitigated by input validation and parameterized queries
5. **Denial of Service**: Mitigated by rate limiting and circuit breakers

### Attack Vectors
- **Network**: TLS protection, certificate validation
- **Application**: Input validation, encryption, secure coding
- **Infrastructure**: Secure configuration, monitoring
- **Social Engineering**: Security awareness, access controls
